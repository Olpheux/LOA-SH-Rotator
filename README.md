Attempts to calculate the optimal skill rotation for every Demonize phase for the Demonic Impulse build of the Shadowhunter class in Lost Ark.

NOTE: This assumes your character is level 60, and has 381 skill points. I have no good way to test the effects levels have, as I only have one character (at level 60). Skill levels don't seem to have any impact on damage in Demonize, but I have seen some people theorize it does - whatever effect it has, I can't find it.

This currently isn't practical to use as it's missing many important things, such as runes, set bonuses, and card sets. 
These make up a noteworthy portion of your total damage, so ignoring them will almost certainly lead to inaccurate results.
