Attempts to calculate the optimal skill rotation for every Demonize phase for the Demonic Impulse build of the Shadowhunter class in Lost Ark.

To run this, simply clone the repo and set up your character in config.json. Documentation on how to set it up can be found in config_documentation.txt. Once configured, run `cargo run` inside the folder.

<b>WARNING</b>: This assumes your character is level 60, and has 381 skill points. I have no good way to test the effects levels have, as I only have one character (at level 60). Skill points don't seem to have any impact on damage in Demonize, but I have seen some people theorize it does - whatever effect it has, I can't find it.

In addition, this currently isn't practical to use for actual gameplay. It's missing many important things, such as runes and set bonuses. 
These make up a noteworthy portion of your total damage, so ignoring them will almost certainly lead to inaccurate results.
