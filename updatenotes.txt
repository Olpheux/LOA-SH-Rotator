v0.1.0 - Aug 22 2022:

Added card decks!
- Currently only supports Lostwind Cliff and Light of Salvation.
    - No other decks I'm aware of are commonly used or really relevant for DPS.
    - Could easily be added if I missed something, though.




v0.0.2 - Aug 21 2022:

- Cleaned up some code aesthetically
- Made some things more consistently formatted
- Added keybind to skills struct
- Fixed bug causing unused skills to get added to unused_skills vec repeatedly
    - This would cause skills to be increasingly more likely to be chosen the longer it's unused
- Fixed linter errors
- Fixed inaccurate logic that would cause Demonize duration to go down if Specialization was low enough
