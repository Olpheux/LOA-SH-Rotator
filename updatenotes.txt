v0.3.0 - Sept 12 2022:

Added importing stats from file!
- Set up in config.json
    - Instructions for setup are in config_documentation.txt
- Changed a few types from i32 to i64
    - Was necessary for importing from json. Probably better this way anyway.
        - Realistically doesn't matter, you can't get 64-bit stats, not even close. But there's less typecasting this way, which is nice.
- Added skeleton for runes
    - Still need to determine exact rune stats - what's the proc chance of Rage?
        - For now, filling out runes in config.json doesn't do anything.
- Added commas and rounding into total damage dealt output


v0.2.0 - Sept 2 2022:

- Implemented after-effects for Ruining Rush and Death Claw
    - These skills give +6% damage for 6 seconds, this was previously unaccounted for.


v0.1.0 - Aug 22 2022:

Added card decks!
- Currently only supports Lostwind Cliff and Light of Salvation.
    - No other decks I'm aware of are commonly used or really relevant for DPS.
    - Could easily be added if I missed something, though.




v0.0.2 - Aug 21 2022:

- Cleaned up some code aesthetically
- Made some things more consistently formatted
- Added keybind to skills struct
- Fixed bug causing unused skills to get added to unused_skills vec repeatedly
    - This would cause skills to be increasingly more likely to be chosen the longer it's unused
- Fixed linter errors
- Fixed inaccurate logic that would cause Demonize duration to go down if Specialization was low enough
