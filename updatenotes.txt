v0.0.2 - Aug 21 2022:

- Cleaned up some code aesthetically
- Made some things more consistently formatted
- Added keybind to skills struct
- Fixed bug causing unused skills to get added to unused_skills vec repeatedly
    - This would cause skills to be increasingly more likely to be chosen the longer it's unused
- Fixed linter errors
- Fixed inaccurate logic that would cause Demonize duration to go down if Specialization was low enough
