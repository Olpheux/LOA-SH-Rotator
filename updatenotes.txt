v1.2.4

- Added DPS output, in addition to total damage

v1.2.3

- File structure cleaned up

v1.2.2

- Progress indicators work better now
    - Update frequency adapts to number of iterations
- Small amount of general code cleanup

v1.2.1

- Progress indicators added

v1.2

- Hallucination set effect adjusted for November balance patch
    - Buildup time to enter Reality for the first time is not accounted for.
      This is mostly fine, as that will be the case as soon as the fight has been ongoing for 9 seconds,
      and the time to build meter to enter Demonize for the first time will be the vast majority of that.

v1.1.1

- Better error handling when file unopenable

v1.1

- Rune support added!

- Simulation code cleaned up
- Bug fix: Hallucination now properly caps at 5 seconds
    - Before it could scale infinitely, which as it turns out, is not what happens in game.

v1.0 - Oct 12 2022:

- Massive code revision
    - Every file rewritten!
    - Using modules properly!
    - Actually some reasonably-structured functions!
    - It's actually good! Wow!
        - ok probably not i still dont entirely know what im doing, but,




v0.4.0 - Sept 20 2022:

- Gear set support added
    - Currently allows for impossible setups (such as 6-piece in 3 sets at once), so just don't do that.

    

v0.3.3.1 - Sept 14 2022:

- Minor change to 'config.json missing' error message to make it more clear how to resolve it.

v0.3.3 - Sept 13 2022:

- Fixed major bug causing raw damage modifiers (such as Grudge's flat +20%) to be weighted at 100x what they should be.
    - This was causing Grudge to be worth +2000% damage, Raid Captain up to +1600%, etc.

v0.3.2 - Sept 12 2022:

- Setup.rs: Changed some !var.is_positive() to var.is_negative()
    - Won't throw errors if value = 0 now.


v0.3.1 - Sept 12 2022:

- Setup.rs: Changed some unwrap() statements to expect()
    - Gives better error messages to the user if values are missing.


v0.3.0 - Sept 12 2022:

Added importing stats from file!
- Set up in config.json
    - Instructions for setup are in config_documentation.txt
- Changed a few types from i32 to i64
    - Was necessary for importing from json. Probably better this way anyway.
        - Realistically doesn't matter, you can't get 64-bit stats, not even close. But there's less typecasting this way, which is nice.
- Added skeleton for runes
    - Still need to determine exact rune stats - what's the proc chance of Rage?
        - For now, filling out runes in config.json doesn't do anything.
- Added commas and rounding into total damage dealt output


v0.2.0 - Sept 2 2022:

- Implemented after-effects for Ruining Rush and Death Claw
    - These skills give +6% damage for 6 seconds, this was previously unaccounted for.


v0.1.0 - Aug 22 2022:

Added card decks!
- Currently only supports Lostwind Cliff and Light of Salvation.
    - No other decks I'm aware of are commonly used or really relevant for DPS.
    - Could easily be added if I missed something, though.




v0.0.2 - Aug 21 2022:

- Cleaned up some code aesthetically
- Made some things more consistently formatted
- Added keybind to skills struct
- Fixed bug causing unused skills to get added to unused_skills vec repeatedly
    - This would cause skills to be increasingly more likely to be chosen the longer it's unused
- Fixed linter errors
- Fixed inaccurate logic that would cause Demonize duration to go down if Specialization was low enough
